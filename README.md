# nnc-webpage

This project was one the first projects I coded at Redwood. We were first introduced to HTML and CSS. I was asked to code a webpage with HTML and CSS using images and making sure the columns were aligned. 

## npm install http-server -g

After installing we can go to our static site directory and can run

## http-server

It will serve the directory on localhost 8080 by default.
